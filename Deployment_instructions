To deploy my multithreaded Spring web application to the cloud, I would select Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my cloud provider. The deployment process would involve the following steps:

Set Up an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):

First, I would create a new repository in Amazon ECR, which will serve as the storage location for my Docker images.
Build and Tag the Docker Image:

Locally, I would build the Docker image of my application and tag it appropriately, typically using the latest tag or a version-specific tag for better version control.
Push the Docker Image to Amazon ECR:

After authenticating to Amazon ECR using the AWS CLI, I would push the built Docker image to the ECR repository I created in step 1.
Deploy Using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS):

With the Docker image stored in ECR, I would proceed to create a task definition in Amazon ECS, which describes how the application should run, including configurations like CPU and memory allocations.
I would then launch an ECS service or run a standalone task using the task definition, which pulls the image from ECR and runs it as specified.
Access the Deployed Application:

Once the ECS service is up and running, I would configure a load balancer to distribute incoming application traffic. This setup helps in managing the load and ensures high availability of the application.
The final step involves mapping a public DNS name to the load balancer, providing users access to the live application through a friendly URL.
